# Gesture-Sentence-Recognition-System
It implements a gesture recognition system that uses both a front-end and a back-end. The back-end, uses Python, leverages the user's camera to detect hand gestures in real-time and classify them using a pre-trained model. Based on the recognized gestures, the system generates corresponding sentences dynamically. The front-end provides a user-friendly interface for interaction, seamlessly integrating with the back-end to display the detected gestures and sentences in real-time.
